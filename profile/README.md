# About us
![Just being Honest](honest.jpg)

We’re on a mission to create more Honest experiences. We’re craftspeople. People who think and do. People who take pride in what we make. People who are always striving to make it better.

Tom & Phil set up Honest Burgers from a tent, serving burgers and chips at parties and festivals. We’ve now got restaurants across the UK. We make British beef patties in our own butchery and rosemary chips that are cut and cooked daily in our chipping room. Every restaurant serves local beers from neighboring breweries, and many of our restaurants serve local burgers using ingredients from nearby food heroes. 

We’re proud of what we’ve achieved over the last 10 years, but we’re even more excited about what we're aiming to achieve in the future.
